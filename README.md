# coffee_machine_simulator
A coffee machine simulator using Java.  

## ðŸ“˜ Features:
- Buy coffee: Espresso, Latte or Cappuccino.
- Add resources to the machine (water, coffee beans, milk, coffee cups).
- Take money from the machine.
- Clean the machine after every 10 cups.
- Show the remaining resources.

## ðŸ“Œ Getting Started  
### Rquirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17.
- A terminal or command prompt.  

## ðŸ“— How to use:
When the program starts, choose an action:
```diff
Write action (buy, fill, take, clean, remaining, exit):
```
#### Actions:
- buy - Choose a type of coffee (Espresso, Latte, or Cappuccino).
- fill - Add water, milk, coffee beans, and cups.
- take - Collect money from the machine.
- clean - Clean the machine after making 10 coffees.
- remaining - Show current machine resources.
- exit - Stop the program.

#### Example:
```diff
Write action (buy, fill, take, clean, remaining, exit):
buy.

What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, back - to main menu: 
3
I have enough resources, making you a coffee!

Write action (buy, fill, take, clean, remaining, exit):
```

## Next Steps:
âœ… Split the program into multiple classes.  
âœ… Optimize code for certain methods.  
âœ… Add a grafical interface using Java Swing or JavaFX.

This is the *Coffee Machine Simulator with Java* project I made myself.

<p>What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you donâ€™t have to make yourself. Itâ€™s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it.<br>
In this project, you'll program a coffee machine simulator using Java. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money.<br>
This project allows you to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and attributes, and get a taste of Java. Practice working with methods, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident with OOP.</p>
